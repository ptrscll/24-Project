# 24-Project
In this app, users can play a modified 24 game where users must use arithmetic operations to combine 4 numbers to 24. 

I worked on this project as part of my high school's Science Research Program, under the mentorship of Professor Hao Wu at Southern Connecticut State University. 

Note that, since I made this during my junior year of high school, this code is not commented very well and may be hard to follow in places.
